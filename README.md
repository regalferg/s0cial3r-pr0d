### Overview

S0cial3r is a social media platform designed to bring together people who have common interests. The site allows users to create profiles, make friends, and SEARCH & JOIN communities within specific games/shows/sports/movies categories. S0cial3r is also used as a recruiting tool used by groups looking to gain members. Whether you are trying to discuss the latest episode of the hottest sitcom or simply looking for a partner to play an online multiplayer game, s0cial3r is for you.

### Getting Started 
1. Create a Profile by visiting the s0cial3r homepage and selecting "REGISTER" (bottom left)
2. You then will be brought to a page where you will fill in your information including your user name/password, a link to a photo of yourself, and your interests. Once completed, click "CREATE PROFILE" 
3. Using the email address and password you provided when you created your profile, you can now log in to see your dashboard page, which will display the picture you inserted, your username, and your profile number. The profile number (upper left-hand corner) also acts as a "home" button which will bring you back to your personal dashboard page when browsing other pages on the site.
